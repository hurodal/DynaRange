--black-level -b <float>
--black-file  -B <file>
Definition: camera RAW black level / totally dark RAW file ideally shot at base ISO (default=black level power of 2 estimation)
Explanation: setting this parameter is optional but it is VERY recommended since all SNR calculations are very sensitive to it. Knowing the black level is mandatory to linearize all sensor data by subtracting it from the RAW values in order to obtain accurate DR measurements
Usage: the most reliable way to proceed is to capture a quick darkframe at base ISO ideally with the camera still cold (-B option). There is also a possibility of providing the parameter if you feel confident enough of your camera's precise black level (-b option). If none of the options are used, rango by default will calculate the lowest power of 2 value where information is found which can be risky
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--black-level -b 255       (provide a black level of 255)
--black-level -b 254.85    (provide a more precise black level of 254.85)
--black-level -B black.dng (provide a darkframe RAW file so that rango calculated the black level)

--chart -c <R G B invgamma>
Definition: create test chart in PNG format ranging colours from (0,0,0) to (R,G,B) with gamma compression (default R=255, G=101, B=164, invgamma=1/1.4)
Explanation: this option allows to create a test chart ("magentachart.png") with patches exactly as rango will expect them to be located. This chart needs to be shot using the camera under test following precise focusing and exposure instructions
Usage: if the desired colour and gamma are not specified, the default values will produce magenta patches and a gamma suited to optimize patch differentiation in most standard displays
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--chart                    (output the default standard magenta patches chart)
--chart -c 255 101 164 1.4 (output the same default standard magenta patches chart)
--chart -c 164 101 255 2   (output a bluish patches chart with a strong compression gamma)

--patch-ratio -r <float>
Definition: relative patch width/height used to compute signal and noise readings (default=0.5)
Explanation: contamination on signal and noise readings, specially from chart blur but also from screen reflections or lens vigneting, will lead to artificially increase noise measurements and hence lowering SNR values and estimated DR. To minimize this the effective area of each patch that will be used can be set: 0.5 means we're using 50% of centred patch width/height, so we're using 25% of the total chart area. Lower values will be more robust vs chart lighting non uniformity, while higher values will collect more samples providing higher statistical robustness
Usage: by default 50% of each patch width/height centred is used. You may set any value between 0 and 1 but values far from 0.5 are not recommended
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--patch-ratio     (50% of patch width/height centred will be used, 25% of patch area)
--patch-ratio 0.5 (50% of patch width/height centred will be used, 25% of patch area)
--patch-ratio 0.6 (60% of patch width/height centred will be used, 36% of patch area)

--snrthreshold-db -d <float>
Definition: SNR threshold in dB for DR calculation (default=12dB (photo DR) and 0dB (engineering DR))
Explanation: to determine the DR, a SNR threshold must be defined. The DR according to that criteria will be the number of stops between sensor saturation and the point at which the SNR curve falls to the specified SNR threshold. This means each threshold will yield different DR values, and they will all be correct according to that criteria
Usage: by default the DR for both 12dB and 0dB DR values is calculated. If specified, only the specified threshold is used
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--snrthreshold-db     (both 12dB and 0dB threshold are used)
--snrthreshold-db 12  (only a 12dB threshold is used)
--snrthreshold-db 6.5 (only a 6.5dB threshold is used)

--drnormalization-mpx -m <float>
Definition: number of Mpx for DR normalization (default=8Mpx)
Explanation: in order to properly and fairly compare different resolution cameras, the SNR values need to be normalized to a given output resolution before calculating the DR. This means DR figures will vary according to this resolution normalization, obtaining higher values the lower the number of Mpx specified
Usage: by default a 8Mpx based DR is calculated. When no normalization is needed (per-pixel DR) a value of 0 must be set for this parameter
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--drnormalization-mpx      (DR normalized to 8Mpx)
--drnormalization-mpx 21.5 (DR normalized to 21.5Mpx)
--drnormalization-mpx 0    (no normalization, per-pixel DR)

--poly-fit -f <int 2-3>
Definition: polynomic order to fit the SNR curve (default=3)
Explanation: the gathered (exposure, SNR) pairs need to be fitted to estimate the SNR curves. This is done through polynomial least squares fitting. For the problem under study, SNR on a digital image sensor, we found that 3rd order curves are in general preferred for increased accuracy while 2nd order are less prone to overfitting
Usage: by default 3rd order (cubic) curves will be used to approximate the SNR response. The alternative is using 2nd order (cuadratic) curves
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--poly-fit   (3rd order curves are used to fit the SNR curves)
--poly-fit 2 (2nd order curves are used to fit the SNR curves)
--poly-fit 3 (3rd order curves are used to fit the SNR curves)

--output-file -o <file> (default="results.csv")
Definition: output CSV text file(s) with all results: black level, sat level, SNR samples, DR values, fitting params (default="results.csv")
Explanation: in a CSV text file chosen by the user all the relevant variables will be output: black level, sat level, SNR samples, DR values, fitting params
Usage: by default the data will be output on a "results.csv" file, which the user can change at convenience
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--output-file                    (output results to "results.csv")
--output-file results_ep5.csv    (output results to "results_ep5.csv")
--output-file results_sonya7.csv (output results to "results_sonya7.csv")

--plot -p <int 0-2> 
Definition: Export SNR curves plot in PNG format with/without the CLI command that generated them (default=0, don't plot)
Explanation: the SNR curves show the SNR in dB achieved for every exposure value in EV with respect to saturation (0EV). They are the best way to display the performance of the sensor in the whole exposure range analysed (deep shadows). In order to export these SNR curves in PNG format a 1-2 parameter must be set
Usage: by default no plot export is performed. 1 will export the SNR curves alone in PNG format, while 2 will add the specific CLI commmand (no filenames) that generated the curves
Examples (first example is default and is equivalent to not specifying the parameter):
--plot   (no plot export)
--plot 1 (plot export of SNR curves in PNG format without CLI command)
--plot 2 (plot export of SNR curves in PNG format adding CLI command)
